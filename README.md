# API Simple Chat

## üí° Project's Idea

This project was developed while studying Go, Docker and Kubernetes. It aims to create a simple chat API.

## üîç Features

* Create new accounts;
* Connect with other users;
* Chat with you contacts;

## üõ† Technologies

During the development of this project, the following techologies were used:

- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [Gin Web Framework](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
- [gomock](https://github.com/golang/mock)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/tree/master/cmd/migrate)
- [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev/)
- [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)

## üíª Project Configuration

### First, you must install these tools:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) for Windows or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for Mac
- [migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/tree/master/cmd/migrate)
- [choco](https://chocolatey.org/install) and [choco install make](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2532234/how-to-run-a-makefile-in-windows) for Windows
- [sqlc](https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/stable/overview/install.html) (for Windows, we'll use it on a Docker image)

### Setting up infrastructure:

Starting postgres container, creating database and running database migration up all versions:

```bash
$ make postgres
$ make createdb
$ make migrateup
```

## üåê Setting up config files

**Important Observation**: the files which will be copied to the Docker image being built must have the End of Line (EOL) sequence as 'LF' (Line Feed). If it's set to 'CRLF' (Carriage Return + Line Feed), it might cause some errors like "*exec /app/start.sh: no such file or directory*" or "*error: parse "postgresql://root:secret@localhost:5432/simple_bank?sslmode=disable\r": net/url: invalid control character in URL*".

## ‚èØÔ∏è Running

To run the application locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ make server
```

## üî® Project's *Deploy*

In order to deploy the application to the kubernetes cluster ...
